## Tools and Resources

- **Terraform Development Workflow**: Follow security-focused development process via `terraform://workflow_guide`
- **GCP Best Practices**: Access GCP-specific guidance via `terraform://gcp_best_practices`
- **GCP Provider Resources**: Access resource listings via `terraform://gcp_provider_resources_listing`

## Prerequisites

1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
2. Install Python using `uv python install 3.10`
3. Install Terraform CLI for workflow execution
4. Install Checkov for security scanning
5. Set up GCP authentication (gcloud CLI recommended)

## Installation

### Install FastMCP

We recommend using `uv` to install and manage FastMCP:

```bash
uv add fastmcp
```

Alternatively, install directly with pip or uv pip:

```bash
uv pip install fastmcp
# or
pip install fastmcp
```

### Install FastMCP (with models support)

The PyPI release of FastMCP may not include the `fastmcp.models` submodule required by the CLI. To install the latest code directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp.git@main#egg=fastmcp
```

Then verify with:
```bash
fastmcp version
```

### Verify Installation

Run:

```bash
fastmcp version
```

For more details, see the FastMCP docs: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp

Here are some ways you can work with MCP: (e.g. for an MCP client configuration):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gcp-terraform-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["gcp-terraform-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

or docker after a successful `docker build -t gcp-terraform-mcp-server .`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gcp-terraform-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "--interactive",
        "--env",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR",
        "gcp-terraform-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

To run and develop locally:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Upgrade pip and install project dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

3. Run the MCP server

```bash
uvicorn gcp_terraform_mcp_server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

4. (Optional) To use the script entry point

```bash
gcp-terraform-mcp-server
```

Ensure that `fastmcp` and other dependencies are installed successfully. If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp.models'`, make sure the virtual environment is active and the dependencies installed without errors.

## Running the Server

Instead of invoking the main module directly, use the FastMCP CLI to start your server:

```bash
# Start with stdio transport (default)
fastmcp run src/gcp_terraform_mcp_server/main.py:mcp

# Or start as an SSE server on port 8080
fastmcp run src/gcp_terraform_mcp_server/main.py:mcp --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Make sure you have `fastmcp` installed in your active environment. This CLI automatically locates the `mcp = FastMCP(...)` instance exported in your `main.py`.

## Security Considerations

When using this MCP server, you should consider:
- **Following the structured development workflow** that integrates validation and security scanning
- Reviewing all Checkov warnings and errors manually
- Fixing security issues rather than ignoring them whenever possible
- Documenting clear justifications for any necessary exceptions
- Using the RunCheckovScan tool regularly to verify security compliance
- Following GCP security best practices for your infrastructure

Before applying Terraform changes to production environments, you should conduct your own independent assessment to ensure that your infrastructure would comply with your own specific security and quality control practices and standards, as well as the local laws, rules, and regulations that govern you and your content.
